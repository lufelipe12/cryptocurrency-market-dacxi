# Cryptocurrency Dacxi Wallet

### In this project i used Vue3, Vite for development axios and animate.css as main tecnologies.

This is my first project in Vue3, a lot of work has been done. I appreciate the opportunity to learn new tecnologies everyday and that's kind of challenge to me. 

This app depends on https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/ to work so if it's down problably it won't work, please check api status on https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation.

The code decisios was made to make easy to understand the files and to locate easily what something does and where the functionality is.
I use a lot of setInterval to control requisitions and responses. It's not the best solution but i tried to make a functionality work.
